Consider the Observation effective element

But in R4, the choices were expanded to include Timing and instant:
http://hl7.org/fhir/observation-definitions.html#Observation.effective_x_

So we define an additional "Normalize Interval", both functions work now
NOTE: QI-Core Observation is still constrained to the set of (dateTime|Period), but since we're using just FHIR, all the options are available
If the system provides a Timing, that's actually non-compliant with QI-Core, so we
are safe to throw an error for that case in this function:
