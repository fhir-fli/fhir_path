/*
This document is a walk-through for developing the CQL by translating from the QDM version of a measure.
As such, it contains re-definitions of several expressions as they are modified during the walk-though,
so the library as it is will not compile (duplicate expressions).

The final version of the measure is in the CMS146.cql document, and the Test146_v5_1_Artifacts folder
contains the HQMF output of the measure package from the Measure Authoring Tool.
*/

/*
This example is a work in progress and should not be considered a final specification
or recommendation for guidance. This example will help guide and direct the process
of finding conventions and usage patterns that meet the needs of the various stakeholders
in the measure development community.
