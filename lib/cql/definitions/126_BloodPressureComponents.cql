how would I find patients whose most recent BP observation
occurred in the last year and has a systolic component
that's greater than 140 or a diastolic component
that's greater than 80?
*/

/*
First, consider the bp profile defined in base FHIR (and reused in US-Core and QI-Core):
http://hl7.org/fhir/bp.html

This profile requires that blood pressure readings be represented as an Observation
with the following characteristics:

Observation
  code: 85354-9|LOINC
  component: [
    {
      code: 8480-6|LOINC,
      value: Quantity in mm[Hg]
    },
    {
      code: 8462-4|LOINC,
      value: Quantity in mm[Hg]
    }
  ]
*/

/*
Using this established structure, we can find the answer by first,
defining expressions that return the set of qualifying diastolic
and systolic readings:

NOTE: We do these separately since measure intent does not require that
the diastolic and systolic be on the measurement, only the same day
