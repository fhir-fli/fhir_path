Issue: Different systems will provide different data for medications, we will
review alternative approaches to calculating doses per day with QDM medication statements.

Source data from Medications in QDM:

*/

/*
Medication, Active
  dosage - quantity to be taken at a single administration
  supply - number of doses supplied
  frequency - how frequently the medication is administered
  relevantPeriod - covers when the medication is first known to be used to when the medication is discontinued

Medication, Administered
  dosage - quantity to be taken at a single administration
  supply - number of doses supplied
  frequency - how frequently the medication was administered
  relevantPeriod - when a single medication administration event starts to the end of the administration

Medication, Discharge
  dosage - quantity to be taken at a single administration
  frequency - how frequently the medication should be administered
  supply - number of doses supplied per refill
  refills - number of refills allowed by the prescription
  authorDatetime - when the discharge medication list was authored

Medication, Dispensed
  dosage - quantity to be taken at a single administration
  supply - number of doses supplied per refill
  frequency - how frequently the medication is administered
  refills - number of refills allowed by the prescription
  relevantPeriod - covers when the administration of the medication is expected to start and end

Medication, Order
  dosage - quantity to be taken at a single administration
  supply - number of doses supplied per refill
  frequency - how frequently the medication should be administered
  refills - number of refills allowed by the prescription
  relevantPeriod - covers when the administration of the medication is expected to start and end

NOTE: This calculation assumes "scheduled dosing" or "around-the-clock dosing", it does not consider
cases where PRN or as needed is part of the medication prescription.
*/

/*
This calculation method is using frequency directly to determine the number of doses per day
In QDM, we only have one frequency (not a range), so there's guidance to be given to the 
provider system to specify what to present

An alternative calculation method is to use the duration of the relevant period 
and the days supply to determine the number of doses per day:
*/

  ["Medication, Order": "Opioid Medications"] O
    return {
      dosesPerDay: 
        O.supply * (1 + Coalesce(O.refills, 0)) /
          duration in days of O.relevantPeriod

      repeat - repeat frequency - frequencyMax times per period
        frequency - number of times per period (lower bound)
        frequencyMax - number of times per period (upper bound, if specified)
        period - duration of the period (e.g. per day, per hour, per week, etc., represented as a UCUM duration quantity)
      code - coded frequency (e.g. BID, TID, QID, etc.)
