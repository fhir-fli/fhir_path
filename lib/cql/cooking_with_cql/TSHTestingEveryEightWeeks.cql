using QDM version '5.5'

/*
The measure is to look for patients for whom TSH testing is performed at least once
every 8 weeks while receiving an ICI for a maximum duration of 1 year from the start
of ICI therapy. Therapy given from prior year through the measurement period. For
instance, if the measurement is 2021, we are only interested in therapy that starts in
2020. The therapy could end in 2020, or 2021, or does not end at all. Also, for the
purposes of the measure, we are only interested within 1 year of therapy from the
start of therapy. For example, if the patient starts therapy in January 2020 and
ends therapy March 2021 (that’s more than 1 year), we are only interested in
January 2020 – January 2021. The first 8-week time interval calculation begins
with the patient’s therapy start date. The actual date of each test does not
influence the subsequent intervals. The result is to calculate if the patient got
at least 1 TSH test per each 8-week period (Week 0-8, week 8-16, week 16-24,
week 24-32, week 32-40, week 40-48, week 48-56).

Calculation of the intervals using the following:

           Bin 1: Week 0-8 from therapy start date
           Bin 2: Week 8-16 from therapy start date
           Bin 3: Week 16-24 from therapy start date
           Bin 4: Week 24-32 from therapy start date
           Bin 5: Week 32-40 from therapy start date
           Bin 6: Week 40-48 from therapy start date
           Bin 7: Week 48-56 from therapy start date

       If patient stops therapy before exactly 12 months (1-year) from therapy start date,
       look for 1 TSH test within the bin the patient therapy end date falls into

       If patient is still on therapy when they reach 1-year from therapy start date,
       look for a final TSH test within bin 7 (week 48-56)

       If patient is on therapy for < 8 weeks, look for 1 TSH test within bin 1

// It should work the way it is written, though I'm a little unsure about the behavior of
// the "Test Lab and Bin" expression.
// It might be more clear to do something like this:
// This returns the bin numbers, 1 through n
// QUESTION: I added curly brackets to save properly in the MAT without errors.
// Is the addition of the curly brackets appropriate? The return type for this is: list<interval<System.Integer>
// ANSWER: CQL 1.5 introduces an overload of expand that takes a singleton interval, this logic is relying on that
// In CQL 1.4, expand takes a List<Interval>>, so to make this 1.4 compatible, use the list overload:
// Note that in the 1.4 version, the result is a list of unit intervals, so we use `point from` to
// return just the bin numbers

//  expand Interval[1, "Required Bins"] // { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 }

  ( expand { Interval[1, "Required Bins"]} ) X
    return point from X

// Then use the bin numbers to construct 8 week intervals, beginning at the start of ICI
// QUESTION: Would you mind clarifying why 1 needs to be subtracted here?
// ANSWER: The bin numbers are 1 through N, so we subtract 1 on the start because we
// want that to represent the beginning of the interval. For example, when processing
// the interval for the first bin, we want it to be:
// Interval["Start of ICI" + 0 weeks, "Start of ICI" + 8 weeks]
// when processing the interval for the second bin, we want it to be:
// Interval["Start of ICI" + 8 weeks, "Start of ICI" + 16 weeks]
// QUESTION: Error message in the MAT: could not resolve call to operator
// Subtract with signature (interval<System.Integer>, System.Integer)
// ANSWER: This is a side-effect of the use of the CQL 1.5 expand, versus the 1.4 expand
// so the fix above will resolve this issue

    return Interval["Start of ICI" + ( ( Bin - 1 ) * 8 weeks ), "Start of ICI" + ( Bin * 8 weeks )]

// Then in the numerator:
// QUESTION: There’s a possibility that a patient can have more than 1 TSH in a bin.
// In this instance, that should still meet the intent. With the use of the ‘=’ operator
// here, I just want to double check with you if this scenario would still be true.
// ANSWER: Yes, equal is still appropriate here, multiple test results will show up
// in the `with` clause of the above `ICI Therapy Bin Periods with Required Test Lab`
// so the result of that expression will still be the Bin Numbers that have appropriate
// tests, no matter how many tests are in each Bin Number.
